This is the PyScript version of [PyAlgoViz](https://github.com/laffra/pyalgoviz)

 - The UI is entirely written in Python, using PyScript/LTK. See [main.py](main.py).
 - The code runs locally in the browser using a worker. See [worker.py](worker.py).
 - Still needs work on things, but the basics are working

# Using MicroPython for fast startup

# Using PyOdide in a worker
